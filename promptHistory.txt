My overarching strategy to accomplish this was to get a working python file and
then allow it to be accessed through an HTML site. Working with libraries such
as pygame proved to be difficult as there were compatibility issues that had to
be translated back and forth through prompts.

I was having a lot of issues working with pygame and getting the game to
properly show up in an HTML. Instead I opted to have the whole file in a single
HTML File. My prompt history with DeepSeek is below.

When specific environment details are not fully constrained, getting working
versions from prompts became increasingly difficult.


Prompt History:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial Request:
Can you make a python version of crossy road in a python file ? I want to be able to put this on a personal website for people that visit it to play

Follow-up about Deployment:
I have the python file in a file. How can I get this to run on an html website ?

Pygbag Installation Issue:
i installed pygbag using pip3 and when I try to run pygbag --build --template index.html crossyRoad.py it says that pygbag does not exist

Pygbag Path Issue:
it finds that pygbag exists, but when I run a command it does not recognize pygbag

Successful Build, but Web Deployment Issues:
I successfully built the game. Now how do I get this to show up on a html file accessed locally or through github pages

Game Not Loading on Localhost:
I was able to load it through localhost. I find that when I load it it says loading game please wait, I have not yet seen the actual game

GitHub Pages Issue:
Great. I was able to get my github repository updated. The actual game itself is not loading. Is this an issue with the actual python file ? What can we do to fix it

Repository Link:
This is the github repo url. jorgecastano1.github.io/113_CrossyRoad. It is still not working

Missing Build Files:
in build/web all that is there is an apk file a png and an index.html.

Pygbag Build Issue:
When I run the bash command to build using pygbag it produces the exact same files.

Clarification on Build Folder:
is __target__ supposed to be the web folder

Pygbag Error Output:
*pygbag 0.9.2*

Request for Simpler Method:
is there a simpler way to do this with the python file we have

Affirmative Response:
yes

Request for Step-by-Step File List:
I have the new repository. Make a list of the files I need to make and what I need to populate them with step by step.

Request for Python File:
I am at step 4, can you provide the python file.
