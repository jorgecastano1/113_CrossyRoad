I was having a lot of issues working with pygame and getting the game to
properly show up in an HTML. Instead I opted to have the whole file in a single
HTML File. My prompt history with DeepSeek is below.


When specific environment details are not fully constrained, getting working
versions from prompts becomes increasingly difficult.
